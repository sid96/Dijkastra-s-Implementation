# Dijkastra-s-Implementation
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. 
The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
